# Contributing to Weatherly

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Contributing Rules
- Always branch off the `main` branch unless advised to do otherwise by the maintainers
- Before working on a bug/feature, make sure there is an issue for the same created and that it is assigned to you. We may not accept your Pull requests if it's not particularly assigned to you.
- Make as much minimal changes as possible to fix the issue you're solving, and do not solve multiple issues at once.
- Update documentation if there's updates to existing workflow/APIs.

## Contributing Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone **your forked repository** to your computer
3. Head to the issues tab and look for an issue that you like. Issues marked "Good
First Issue" or "Hacktoberfest" are great to start with!
4. Once you have decided what issue to work on, give it a shot!
5. Once done, push the code to your forked repository.
6. Head to the Pull Requests tab and click on "Create New Pull Request"
7. On the left of the arrow should be this repo and on the right should be yours.
8. Add a small description to the Pull Request describing what you've done.
9. Mention what Issue you have worked on. If the issue number is #3, you can mention
"Closes #3" in the Pull Request description.
10. Submit Pull Request

It's that easy! We hope you enjoy contributing to our repository. Don't hesitate to
contact any of the maintainers or ACM team about any problems!
